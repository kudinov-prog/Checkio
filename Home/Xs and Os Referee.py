"""
Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two players (X and O) who take turns 
marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, 
vertical, or diagonal rows (NW-SE and NE-SW) wins the game.

But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee for this games results. 
You are given a result of a game and you must determine if the game ends in a win or a draw 
as well as who will be the winner. Make sure to return "X" if the X-player wins and "O" if the O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return "D".

A game's result is presented as a list of strings, where "X" and "O" are players' marks and "." is the empty cell.
